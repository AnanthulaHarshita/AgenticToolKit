## Why Personal Liability Insurance Matters

Liability insurance provides protection against the risks of being sued for negligence or injury, offering coverage for legal expenses and settlement payments if you are found liable. In Ontario, the consequences of facing legal claims without adequate insurance can be financially devastating.
